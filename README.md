# Weather Trend Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project analyzes and forecasts global weather trends using the Global Weather Repository dataset. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, time series forecasting with ARIMA and Prophet, machine learning with Random Forest, ensemble modeling, feature importance analysis using SHAP, and interactive spatial mapping.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing temperature distributions and correlations.  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Using Isolation Forest to identify unusual weather events.  
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Modeling temperature trends for cities using ARIMA and Prophet.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Random Forest and ensemble forecasts to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Feature Importance:** SHAP analysis to interpret influential climate factors.  
- **Spatial Analysis:** Interactive world map displaying average temperatures by city.
